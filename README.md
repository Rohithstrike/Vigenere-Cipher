# Vigenère Cipher Tool

The **Vigenère Cipher Tool** is a web-based application designed to easily encode and decode messages using the Vigenère Cipher. This classical encryption algorithm uses a keyword to perform polyalphabetic substitution, offering a higher level of security compared to simple substitution ciphers.

## Features

- **Encode Text**: Encrypt plaintext using a provided key.  
- **Decode Text**: Decrypt encrypted text using the same key.  
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly web interface that allows easy interaction.  
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on all modern browsers without additional setup.  

## Live Demo

Try the Vigenère Cipher Tool directly in your browser: [Live Demo](https://rohithstrike.github.io/Vigenere-Cipher/)  

## How to Use

1. **Enter Text**:  
   - If encoding, input the plaintext you wish to encrypt.  
   - If decoding, input the ciphertext you want to decrypt.  
2. **Enter Key**: Provide the cipher key, which should consist of alphabetic characters only.  
3. **Select Action**:  
   - Choose "Encode" to encrypt the message.  
   - Choose "Decode" to decrypt the message.  
4. **View Result**: The output will be displayed in the results section below the input fields.  

### Example Usage

#### Encoding
- **Plaintext**: `HELLO WORLD`  
- **Key**: `KEY`  
- **Encoded Text**: `RIJVS UYVJN`  

#### Decoding
- **Ciphertext**: `RIJVS UYVJN`  
- **Key**: `KEY`  
- **Decoded Text**: `HELLO WORLD`
