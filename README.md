# Vigenère Cipher Tool

The Vigenère Cipher Tool is a web-based application designed to easily encode and decode messages using the Vigenère Cipher. This classical encryption algorithm uses a keyword to perform polyalphabetic substitution, offering a higher level of security compared to simple substitution ciphers.

## Features

- **Encode Text**: Encrypt plaintext using a provided key.
- **Decode Text**: Decrypt encrypted text using the same key.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly web interface that allows easy interaction.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works on all modern browsers with no additional setup.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version of the Vigenère Cipher tool [here](#) *(link to live demo if hosted online)*.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Text**: Type or paste the plaintext you want to encode or the ciphertext you want to decode.
2. **Enter Key**: Input the cipher key (a string of alphabetic characters) used for both encoding and decoding.
3. **Select Action**: Choose between "Encode" or "Decode" based on your requirement.
4. **View Result**: The encoded or decoded text will appear below in the result section.

### Example Usage

- **Plaintext**: `HELLO WORLD`
- **Key**: `KEY`
- **Encoded Text**: `RIJVS UYVJN`
- **Decoded Text**: `HELLO WORLD`
